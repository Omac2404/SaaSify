# SaaS Landing Page & Dashboard (Responsive Portfolio Project)

This project is a full-stack web application designed to showcase core Junior Frontend Developer skills, focusing on **exceptional responsive design** and modern component architecture using React and Tailwind CSS. The backend provides a secure simulation of an authentication flow.

## ✨ Key Features

* **Flawless Responsive Design:** Built entirely with Tailwind CSS utilities to ensure perfect scaling across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
* **Modern UI Components:** Features a responsive navigation bar (hamburger menu on mobile), a 3-tier responsive Pricing Table, and a minimalist Dashboard UI.
* **Authentication Simulation:** Minimal Node.js/Express.js backend handles mock user login/logout using **In-Memory State**.
* **Security Awareness:** The backend demonstrates best practices by simulating password hashing using `bcrypt` for the hardcoded test user.
* **Monorepo Structure:** Organized using the Antigravity pattern with separate workspaces for `frontend`, `backend`, and shared `auth-types`.
